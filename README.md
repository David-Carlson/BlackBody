# BlackBody Radiatino Simulator
I simulated blackbody radiation, which is light (and other spectrums) given off an object due to heat. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-body_radiation) elaborates well on this. 
For a given heat, I can calculate the power of any particular wavelength of electro-magnetic radiation.

This can be done through Plank's law of black-body radiation:

## Synopsis

At the top of the file there should be a short introduction and/ or overview that explains **what** the project is. This description should match descriptions added for package managers (Gemspec, package.json, etc.)

## Code Example

Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Motivation

A short description of the motivation behind the creation and maintenance of the project. This should explain **why** the project exists.

## Installation

Provide code examples and explanations of how to get the project.

## API Reference

I used the [Sunflow Render Engine](http://sunflow.sourceforge.net/docs/javadoc/) to help draw images as well as handle parts of the spectrum conversion.


## Contributors

Let people know how they can dive into the project, include important links to things like issue trackers, irc, twitter accounts if applicable.
